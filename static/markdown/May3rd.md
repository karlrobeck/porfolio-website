# Sandigan Solo Food Trip

*Date: May 3 2024*

Well for now, no more coding for today. my girlfriend `Vivien` is sick right now so i decided to escort her home. i live in caloocan while she live in quezon city. its quite far from home but hey. anything for my girlfriend. after i escorted her. i'm bored and decided to eat alone and try to flex it to my girlfriend when she got home.

Now, let's rate the food that i eat in sandigan. i usually eat at `litex wet market` when i escort my girlfriend to her home. but for today since we dropped at sandigan. i decided to eat there instead.

first thing i try is their siomai for `25 pesos` for `5 siomai`.

**Rating:** 10/10

That's a steal for that price  and it's not those cheap siomai that taste like rat or something. i quite love it to be honest.

Next food to rate is `longhair's pares`. if there is a `hiwaga` pares in litex. here in sandigan there is `longhair` and her `pares meal`.

**Rating:** 7/10

It's quite good for a meal its only 50 pesos for a meal and it's quite good but not the best to be honest because its to sour for me and the meat is just few.

Next!

After eating, i want to drink. i found this store that they sell melon and kalamares i tried to eat the kalamares first before drinking my melon drink.

Now let's rate the drink.

**Rating:** 8/10

It's refreshig but i have to rate it a 8 because not sweet anymore because of ice.

But eating in sandigan is not only the event there. I also witness gospel music while eating my kalamares and drinks.
