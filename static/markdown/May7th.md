# A ton of school works and my Mom's birthday

*Date: May 7 2024*

<br>

This is just a quick blog because im super busy today. i have coding deadline for my banana-classroom. potential meeting for my new client and my mom's birthday.

I just want to say Happy birthday to my mom. even though we don't talk a lot. I will still support you someday. 

my coding deadline is today for my banana-classroom because this week will be the data gathering for my client and they needed the system. I'm currently polishing the system for them to use it tomorrow.

A lot of deadline are coming in a few days. i still think about what i wear on the great books on thursday. we have a cosplay reinactment of `Alice in the wonderland`. I am thinking right now of a character that is fitted for my personality and cheap to cosplay and easy to act.
