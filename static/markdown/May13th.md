# Final Blog

*Date: May 13 2024*

<br>

Today, is the final day of my blog series. i enjoyed writing this blogs in my system. as you might know, i built this system from scratch for my porfolio website. i showcase my work here and the system that i built. in the blog series i also tell my every day stories. and somewhat here is just a summary of it.

*My daily routine*

- wake up
- go to school
- study
- date with my girlfriend if we're both free
- go home
- do some chores
- make assignments
- code at night
- sleep

That's basically it, my daily routine. but am i happy? yes because those things that i do for some are repeatitive and don't have the `fun` element on it. for me it's not true actually because when i code, i learn new things that i can incorporate with my career. at some point on my college career i'll be able to pay my tuition and spend things that i want because of my line of work.

The reason why i also do this coding stuff and not playing anymore is not because im not a gamer anymore. it's just i just want to show to myself what i meant to be and how it can help me build a better life than this.

playing is not bad, hanging out with friends is not bad, but i chose this because this line of work will have be the best investment of my life. if i want to create a family someday. i don't want them to suffer financially and i want to be a good person / father to them someday. that's why im trying to discipline myself starting today.

I hope you read all of my blogs and learn to my everyday life. It'll change someday but for now. this is where im at. i'll see you again!
