# New gear setup

Today, I finally got money to spend for my equipment here. i ordered things that will help me a lot when coding and it helps me become more productive.

The things that i've bought and how much they cost.

- Laptop Monitor mount: 999 Pesos
- 2tb External Hard Disk Drive: 650 Pesos (Spoiler: It's sucks)
- Use Connection: 150 Pesos:

Total: 1799 Pesos.

Although the External Hard disk is a scam (It's so slow i can't use it to transfer my major files to my new hard disk drive).

It's still a good investment to have because i can now be more productive when i do my homework, talk to clients and develop more.
