# Im late and missed my PE Exams

*Date: May 8 2024*

<br>

Today has been an exceptionally unlucky day for me. It all started when my alarm clock failed to ring in the morning. Because of this, I missed my Physical Education (PE) Exams and Teaching Practicum (TP) for this pre-finals period. This is the first time I have ever missed an exam or a practicum session, and it has left me feeling quite distressed. 

I am particularly concerned because these assessments are crucial for my overall grade, and missing them could significantly impact my final scores. Understanding the importance of these evaluations, I plan to approach my instructor to discuss my situation. I intend to explain what happened and seek guidance on any possible steps I can take to make up for the missed scores. Whether it involves rescheduling the exam, completing an alternative assignment, or any other form of evaluation, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that my grades do not suffer due to this unfortunate incident. 

I hope that my instructor will understand the circumstances and provide me with a fair opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge and skills. This incident has taught me the importance of having backup plans for important events and ensuring that I am well-prepared to avoid such mishaps in the future.
