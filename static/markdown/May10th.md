# New Date Ideas

*Date: May 10 2024*

Today, my girlfriend is now okay. and we can now finally date again! wohoo!! we decided to somewhat change the pace when we go to dates because what we typically do on dates is.

We go to a mall specifically `Fairview Terraces` where we eat fast food and hang out for a while. after finishing up food, we go for a walk for like 15 to 30 mins just to hang out even more and after that we go home.

that's the status quo for me and my girlfriend `Vivien` for like months now. now we change it a bit because the food that we eat is somewhat repeatetive and unhealty if we maintain it for longer. that's why from now on we will try different food stores and eat the foods that they sell.

Eating this is so good that for the next dates that we do. we will include this to our list.

I am so happy right now because i can now finally date with my girlfriend again and i don't have any more things to do so that's a plus.
