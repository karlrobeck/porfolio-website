# MobProg Dilemma

Today, is the deadline of our MobProg Task Performance. Andrei is my partner and we decided to collaborate on this Task Performance together. we build a mobile application that can add expectation vs reality stuff. the functional requirements in order to complete this activity must be:

Legend:

- [X] - complete
- [] - incomplete


**Functional Requirements:**

- [] It must show an expectation image and a reality image
- [X] It must swap between those two
- [X] It must cycle to the previous and next iteration

We didn't able to show the image itself for specific reason. yes we finish the implementation of the system but on the instruction and handouts. they dont really provide instruction on how to integrate `Gallery` to the application. since i don't have a android phone, i only have a `Apple Iphone`. I decided to use emulator. 

We can't really use the development folder in the android studio because if the application compiles and Andrei uses it in his phone. images will not be shown. that's why we use database because it can be easily replicated and make things work as expected. 

The main problem that we have and i specifically struggle with is the deprecated version of `startActivityOnResult` function in java because there is a newer implementation of it and it's out of the scope of the activity. hence i'm stuck with this code.

We've spend 5 hours doing the activity and passed it in a failed state. my system crashed because of long hours of emulating the system and we don't really have a choice but to passed it because it's near deadline. Hopefully we didn't get a failing grade for that :(
