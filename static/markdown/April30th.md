# **Personal FastAPI Web Development Journal / AppCon Deadline**

*Date: April 30, 2024*

**Dear Journal,**

Today, I embark on a journey to explore FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. Armed with my expertise in Python programming, I'm excited to dive deep into FastAPI and discover its capabilities for creating fast, efficient, and scalable web applications.

<br>

## Introduction to FastAPI:
FastAPI has been making waves in the Python community for its impressive performance and ease of use. Built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI combines the simplicity of Flask with the performance of asynchronous programming, making it an ideal choice for building high-performance APIs and web services.

<br>

#### **Getting Started:**
To begin my journey with FastAPI, I start by installing the framework and creating a new project directory. With a simple `pip install fastapi uvicorn`, I'm ready to start building my first FastAPI application.

**Creating a Simple Web App:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create an instance of the FastAPI class
app = FastAPI()

# Define a route for the root endpoint
@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
```

**Understanding the Code:**
- We import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module.
- We create an instance of the `FastAPI` class called `app`.
- We define a route for the root endpoint using the `@app.get()` decorator. When a GET request is made to the root endpoint ("/"), the `read_root()` function is called.
- Inside the `read_root()` function, we return a dictionary containing a simple message.

<br>

#### **Running the Application:**
To run our FastAPI application, we use the Uvicorn ASGI server:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

<br>

#### **Reflections**
As I run my first FastAPI application and navigate to the root endpoint in my browser, I'm impressed by how quickly and effortlessly I was able to get up and running. The simplicity of the framework's syntax combined with its powerful features for handling requests and responses make it a joy to work with.

**Next Steps:**
With my first FastAPI application successfully running, I'm eager to explore more advanced features such as request validation, dependency injection, and database integration. Armed with my expertise in Python and newfound knowledge of FastAPI, I'm confident that I can build robust and scalable web applications to meet any challenge.

**Closing Thoughts:**
As I close this journal entry, I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for the journey ahead. FastAPI holds immense promise for the future of web development in Python, and I'm thrilled to be along for the ride.

**Happy coding!**
