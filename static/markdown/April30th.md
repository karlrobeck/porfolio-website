## AppCon Submission Deadline

Today, is the deadline for our app development competition called AppCon, we consist of 8 members, 4 C.S students and 4 I.T students. we represent `STI Fairview` for this event. The app that we try to develop is called `EROG`. it's a mobile app similar to Grab or Uber but specifically for public transport. 

We vision it as a somewhat new innovation in the public transport space because of how we are now integrated with technology to our daily lives and that includes transport. we think that it can help many people navigate, commute and pay online just like Grab and other private transport apps. and it also aligns to the theme of the competition. solve social issues.

The development process of the application is super rough because of budget issues that i can't utilize because i am the lead backend developer for the team and i supervise the deployment of the system that will be used in partner with the mobile application.

We don't have a server for deploying my system and serve it globally. because of that i am force to somewhat provide for the team temporarily for the server. I hosted my system in `Amazon web services` where they provide `Virtual Servers` that i can use to deploy my system. it lasted for atleast like 20 days or so.

But let me tell you, it isn't enough because yes we have a working server and i presented it to my adviser back then but big problem coming up! its now working. Yes its not working, why? it's not because of the `Virtual Server` of mine. its the domain. because i'm already spending for the `Virtual Server` i can't affort to buy a specific domain just to serve my system. Why domain is important you may ask? let me tell you why.

Domain is a address that is converted into words. say for example [Facebook](https://facebook.com) (www.facebook.com) the `www` is the subdomain `facebook.com` is the address.

The purpose of domain is to provide easy access to services like facebook with just a word. but it isn't free because of major reason which is `Security`. because if bad `actors` or `hacker` can create domains they can easily fool internet user and steal their information. it is also called `Man in the middle attack` refer to this [link](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=man+in+the+middle+attack) for more information 

Another security measures that domain provides that we badly need is `encryption`. because we are deploying my backend system globally. information that passes in the internet space `MUST` be encrypted in order for safe use. the protocol that is use for that is `HTTPS` you can see if you are reading this blog in the url that this blog system of mine is encrypted and uses `HTTPS` and for good reason. if i want to deploy my system in the public internet space i must have the responsibility to protect my data and my reader's data.

now let's go back to the development. that's the biggest issue that i'm currently facing and i don't have the capability to provide anymore. my `Virtual Machine` is served globally but it isn't encrypted. i tried to generate my own `HTTPS Certificate` to serve use it as a encryption system but major browsers and even mobile system dont accept `Self Signed Certificates` because of also `Security` reasons. i tried to contact my adviser and ask for a domain that we can use and a certificate. the adviser only gave us the domain but not the certificate. without the two i can't use it domain. that's why i have no choice but to shutdown the `Virtual machine` that i'm currently serving because it's nonsense and i can't really use the server anymore.

Hence with today, this is the final day of submission of the application. the irony of it is that it's april 30 and `STI Fairview` just provided the server that we need. we can't really use it anymore because its super late and its the last day of the submission. i don't know where the funds will go but yeah. it's done. 

We passed the `repository` and our application to AppCon and hopefully they accept it.
