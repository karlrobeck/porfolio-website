# Update in Banana Classroom

*Date: May 2 2024*

Hello, Good day again. in today's blog i'll give you an update on the progress of banana-classroom. today is the final deadline of banana-classroom that my clients commissioned to me. my job is to create a system that handles quizzes and classroom for them to answer in. it's more like a stripped downed version of quzzizz or STI's ELMS system.

So how do i built it? let's talk about the tech stack that i used for this project. the banana-classroom system has 2 version v1 and v2. the v1 version is based on python programming language for all of its transaction but if you read the April 30th blog. i faced a similar problem with my `Virtual machine` that's why we migrated to v2 where in we use `Typescript` a typed version of javascript.
we use vercel to deploy the app. the database that we use is `DynamoDB` for saving user information and making it more useful.

the progress that i want to share with you is that its almost done. some minor changes needs to be updated and fix before giving it to the client so that they can use it for data gathering.

after the data gathering we will try to redesign the UI part so that it is also appealing to the consumer that will use the app.

if you want to use the banana-classroom. it's free and you can easily register through this [link](https://banana-classroom.vercel.app)
